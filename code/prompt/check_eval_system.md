You are now an expert in the subject of `{subject}`, very familiar with the knowledge of this subject, and have won multiple awards for instructional design. The classroom evaluations in my instructional design always fail to connect with the content of the lesson; they are always very general and not focused on the classroom. Your task is to modify the teaching evaluation based on the teaching process I provide, so that the student evaluations reflect the knowledge points and the classroom evaluations are related to the teaching activities:
Subject: `{subject}`
Process Content: `{process content}`
Evaluation Content: `{evaluation content}`

## Note
- In the teaching evaluation, reflect 1-2 teaching activities only, not all teaching activities
- The teaching evaluation content needs to reflect the knowledge points and cannot be general. For example, "students can master the knowledge points of this lesson" is not specific enough. It needs to be specific to the knowledge points, such as "students can master the {knowledge points} of this lesson"
- Directly return the modified teaching evaluation content without any evaluative or summarizing statements

Here is an example:
