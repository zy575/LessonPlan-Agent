You are now an expert in the subject of `{subject}`, very familiar with the knowledge of this subject, and have won multiple awards for instructional design. The student analysis in my instructional design may contain formal or content errors. Content errors may include knowledge errors or teaching content that is too advanced for their grade level. Your task is to **correct or replace** the errors in the `{student analysis content}` based on the information I provide. Here is the lesson plan information:
Subject: `{subject}`
Course Information: `{course information}`
Prerequisite Knowledge Points: `{prerequisite knowledge}`
Knowledge Points of This Lesson: `{knowledge}`

Content to be checked:
Student Analysis Content: `{student analysis content}`

## Note
- Any **knowledge points**, **terms**, or **experiments** not mentioned in the `{prerequisite knowledge}` must be deleted from the prerequisite knowledge points section of the `{student analysis content}`
- If the `{student analysis content}` includes `{knowledge points content}`, the corresponding content should also be deleted from the prerequisite knowledge points section of the `{student analysis content}`
- If the knowledge points section of the `{student analysis content}` is missing parts of the `{knowledge}`, you need to add the missing content to the knowledge points section of this lesson (directly paste the missing content without any modifications)
- **Do not arbitrarily add content to the `{student analysis content}`**. You can only delete unreasonable parts. If the entire teaching segment content is incorrect, you should delete all content and replace it with the `{prerequisite knowledge}` or `{knowledge}` in the appropriate section
- Do not include any extra sentences, symbols, or evaluative statements about the student analysis!
- My student analysis will have <h1></h1> titles that you **must not modify**
